# Next - Maintainer Status

**Updated:** 2026-08-11
**Read this first when resuming work.** It is the single source
of truth for "where are we and what's next." For granular tasks see
[TODO.md](./TODO.md); for command usage see [cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md).

---

## Where we are

- **Branch model:** all work lands on `main` **via PR** (never push to main). CI
  must be green before merge. See [[always-pr-to-main]] convention.
- **Tests:** 180 passing (schema 11, core 114, skill 32, cli 11, examples/integrations 12).
  Verify with `pnpm install && pnpm test` (test builds first). Also
  `pnpm dogfood:cursor-hooks` and `pnpm dogfood:claude-hooks` for host
  integration fixtures.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — install → build → typecheck →
  portfolio-name guard → test → release smoke, Node 22.

### What ships today (working, tested)

| Release docs + CI sample | `docs/release`, `integrations/github-actions` | beta release checklist, copyable `conductor drift --ci` workflow, and optional vault-guard pairing sample |
| Setup doctor | `doctor.ts`, `doctor` CLI | local setup diagnostics for config, contract state, archive/index, package version, visible hooks/workflows, and optional vault-guard pairing |
| Drift report | `report.ts`, `report` CLI | PR/CI handoff with contract summary, gate result, drift, AC coverage, pivots, corrections, and recommendation |
| Rules audit | `rules-audit.ts`, `rules audit` CLI | inspects AGENTS/Claude/Gemini/Cursor/Continue/Kiro rules; flags duplicates, stale/broad rules, conflicts, and critical candidates |
| Spec bridge | `spec-bridge.ts`, `import-spec` CLI | imports Spec Kit or Kiro artifacts into an unfrozen Intent Contract draft |
| Public repo validation harness | `scripts/validate-public-repos.mjs` | repeatable manual smoke against 8 public GitHub repos; includes explicit-signal and path-only drift controls |

13. Optional vault-guard pairing: doctor awareness, combined pre-commit sample,
    paired CI sample, and clarified package-install workflow status.
14. v1 readiness pass: `conductor report`, `conductor rules audit`, constraint
    deduplication, path-only drift controls, and broader public-repo validation.
16. Release finish-line polish: init `next_steps`, report `--with-secrets`,
    offline lifecycle fixture, publish script, and README npm guardrails.
17. npm publish `@0.3.0-beta.3` via trusted publisher; `conductor hook install`
    for npm users; v1 launch checklist and stability policy.
18. v1 release prep: extraction dotted-token fix, packages bumped to `1.0.0`,
    CHANGELOG `[1.0.0]` section, and downstream app PR drift gate green on a private downstream app repo.
19. **v1.0.0 shipped** — [PR #25](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/25) merged,
    tag [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/releases/tag/v1.0.0) published;
    all four `@vaultcompass/conductor-*` packages on npm at `1.0.0` (`latest`).
20. downstream app Conductor integration verified on a private downstream app repo
    (repo-local `.githooks` + `Conductor Drift` CI on PRs).
21. Post-v1 hygiene: brief correction dedup/cap (3b partial), `--freeze` deprecation,
    Cursor validation doc ([downstream-app-cursor-integration-2026-07-09.md](./validation/downstream-app-cursor-integration-2026-07-09.md)).
22. **v1.0.2** — downstream app dogfood extraction fixes: `file.ts.` sentence boundaries,
    prohibition false positives, Cursor rule one-contract-per-branch ([PR #29](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/29));
    re-validated — [downstream-app-extraction-2026-07-11.md](./validation/downstream-app-extraction-2026-07-11.md).
23. **v1.0.3** — compound `.test.ts.` sentence boundaries, `Extract` action verb,
    `no-overwrite` prohibition false positive ([#32](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/32)).
24. **v1.0.4** — `doctor` respects `core.hooksPath`; prohibition path extraction
    ([#34](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/34)).
25. **v1.0.5** — drift path/constraint false-positive fixes; mixed-clause extraction;
    rules audit `drift_noisy_rule` ([#36](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/36)).
26. **v1.0.6** — public content hygiene; portfolio-name CI guard
    ([#37](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/37),
    [public-content-policy.md](./release/public-content-policy.md)).
27. **v1.0.7** — hash-only portfolio guard; public hygiene pass on docs/fixtures
    ([#40](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/40), [#43](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/43)).
28. **v1.0.8**: extraction/constraint-loader hardening found via local-repo
    validation (dropped scope clauses, garbled prohibitions, AC bleed into
    out_of_scope, bare-reference and overbroad "require" rule matches)
    ([#46](https://github.com/vaultcompasshq/conductor/pull/46)).
29. **v1.0.9** — Cursor hook dogfood (`pnpm dogfood:cursor-hooks`);
    `hook install` localizes machine-wide `core.hooksPath`; README leads with
    approved contract + drift; no frozen root `.conductor/` contract on `main`
    ([cursor-hook-dogfood-2026-07-21.md](./validation/cursor-hook-dogfood-2026-07-21.md)).
30. **v1.0.10** — Claude Code lifecycle dogfood (`pnpm dogfood:claude-hooks`);
    macOS fix for hook path CSV (`paste -sd, -`); Stop script exits **2** on
    block (Claude Code hard-block semantics);
    ([claude-hook-dogfood-2026-07-21.md](./validation/claude-hook-dogfood-2026-07-21.md)).
31. **v1.1.0**: Change Budget. Optional `budget` block (allowed/protected paths,
    max files, dependency guard) checked against changed file paths in the gate,
    deterministic and offline. Dogfooded against public repos, which caught a
    directory-glob bug (fixed). Plus docs hygiene (test count, CHANGELOG order).
    Design: [plans/2026-07-28-change-budget-design.md](./plans/2026-07-28-change-budget-design.md).

## What's next (priority order)

1. **Change Budget follow-ups.** A small CLI to author the budget instead of
   hand-editing YAML.
2. **Content-level / semantic drift (opt-in).** The gate still reasons over
   paths, not diff contents, so out-of-scope logic added inside an in-scope
   file is not caught. Keep the offline rule scorer as the default and ship an
   opt-in check only after real-session false-positive evidence.
3. **Codex live session.** Exercise the `integrations/codex` sample in a real
   CLI session (shell adapters already shared; interactive `/hooks` trust is
   the gap).
4. **Phase 3b (remaining).** LLM-assisted rule normalization (opt-in); more
   correction decay tuning if brief caps prove insufficient in dogfood.

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for the file-level checklist of each.

## Open findings / known limits

- **Extraction is still rule-based:** multi-sentence scope/AC extraction and
  prohibition handling are sharper now, but human review before
  `conductor-freeze` remains required.
- **Approval is best-effort headless:** `conductor-freeze` requires an explicit
  `--approved-by` in non-interactive runs, but software can't *prove* a human
  approved. Documented limitation, not a bug.
- **Drift scorer is rule-based:** good signal, including path-derived API/source
  and manifest controls, but vocabulary-overlap false positives remain possible;
  LLM-assisted classification is a deferred option.
- **Host lifecycle hooks: Cursor Git gate + Claude scripts proven; Codex interactive pending:**
  Cursor project rules remain advisory; `hook install` is dogfooded.
  Claude Code SessionStart/Stop shell adapters are dogfooded via
  `pnpm dogfood:claude-hooks`. Codex still needs a live `/hooks` trust session.
- **Public repo validation learned:** init/extract/freeze/doctor/check run
  against the default public-repo matrix in `scripts/validate-public-repos.mjs`.
  The matrix now includes explicit-signal and path-only negative controls.
