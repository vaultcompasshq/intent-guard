## Drift example (same contract, turn 40)

**Detected drift:**

| Signal | Evidence | Severity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Scope creep | Diff adds WebSocket real-time sync | critical |
| Constraint violation | New `/api/export` route added | critical |
| Undocumented pivot | "Actually let's also sync live" | high |

**Intent Guard message (soft block):**

> Session drift detected. Contract `ic-20260617-a3f9k2` says client-side CSV only, no new API.  
> Current diff adds `api/export/route.ts` and WebSocket hook.  
> **Options:** (1) Log pivot and update contract (2) Revert drift (3) Override with reason

**Pivot log entry (if user chooses 1):**

```yaml
- timestamp: "2026-06-17T16:45:00Z"
  change: "Add real-time export via API + WebSocket"
  reason: "User needs live data for desk workflow"
  acknowledged_by: user
  updates:
    in_scope_added:
      - "Real-time CSV stream via WebSocket"
    out_of_scope_removed:
      - "No new API endpoint"  # moved to in_scope via pivot
```

## Prompt coaching example (before freeze)

**User said:** "Just quickly add export like Notion does with sharing and maybe PDF too"

**Coach output:**

> **Prompt variance warning**  
> - `just quickly` → models skip edge cases and tests  
> - `like Notion` + `sharing` + `PDF` → 3 product surfaces, not one feature  
>  
> **Suggested rewrite:**  
> "Add CSV download for the current fund table. Client-side only. No PDF, no sharing."
