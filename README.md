# Conductor

**Intent fidelity for AI-assisted development.**

Conductor sits *above* foundation models and *below* your product code. It turns an unstructured request into an approved **Intent Contract**, coaches users when prompts cause scope expansion, and blocks intent drift before misaligned changes reach review.

The Intent Contract is a plain YAML file, so any model or coding assistant that can read a file can consume it. Conductor does not replace spec tools, coding agents, or PR review. It gives those tools a shared source of truth for what the human approved, what is out of scope, and whether the current diff has drifted.

Today the shipped surfaces are the unified `conductor` CLI, the legacy `conductor-check` gate for pre-commit and CI, Cursor/Claude skills, hook samples, handoff reports, rules audit, and spec import. Optional vault-guard pairing samples are available for teams that want intent drift and secret scanning as separate gates. See [integrations/](./integrations) for host-specific examples.

## What Conductor is / isn't

| Is | Isn't |
|----|-------|
| Governance layer for AI coding sessions | A foundation model or fine-tune |
| Intent Contract + drift detection | A full autonomous coding agent |
| User prompt coaching | Replacement for planning, review, or CI |
| Multi-model (Claude, Codex, Gemini) | Cursor-only or single-vendor lock-in |

```

The enforcement gate (`conductor check`, legacy `conductor-check`) returns a non-zero exit code when no
frozen contract exists or staged changes drift past a blocking threshold — the
one place Conductor *enforces* rather than *suggests*. Install it with
`conductor hook install` (add `--with-vault-guard` to pair secret scanning), or
wire the sample hooks
([pre-commit.sample](./integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit.sample),
[vault-guard hook](./integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit-with-vault-guard.sample))
or a CI step from a source checkout.

## Quickstart

### Install (npm)

```bash
npx @vaultcompass/conductor-cli@latest init --project .
npx @vaultcompass/conductor-cli@latest extract --project . --text "Add CSV export. Do not add new API endpoints."
npx @vaultcompass/conductor-cli@latest freeze --project . --approved-by "<you>"
npx @vaultcompass/conductor-cli@latest check --project . --staged
```

Install the pre-commit gate (and optionally pair [vault-guard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/vault-guard) secret scanning):

```bash
npx @vaultcompass/conductor-cli@latest hook install --project . --with-vault-guard
```

This writes a self-contained `.git/hooks/pre-commit`; drop `--with-vault-guard` for intent-only enforcement.

### AI session guardrails

Conductor and vault-guard are independent gates for the same workflow:

| Gate | Tool | Blocks |
|------|------|--------|
| Intent drift | `conductor check --staged` | Work outside the approved contract |
| Secret leakage | `vault-guard scan --staged` | Credentials in staged files |

Use `conductor doctor` to verify setup, `conductor report --staged` for PR/agent handoffs, and `conductor report --staged --with-secrets` when vault-guard is installed.

### Develop from source

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm conductor -- init --project .
pnpm conductor -- doctor --project .
pnpm conductor -- extract --project . --text "Add CSV export. Do not add new API endpoints. Verify the file downloads."
pnpm conductor -- import-spec --project . --from kiro --spec-dir .kiro/specs/export
pnpm conductor -- freeze --project . --approved-by "<name>"
pnpm conductor -- check --project . --staged
pnpm conductor -- report --project . --staged
pnpm conductor -- rules audit --project .
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test      # 173 tests (builds first, then schema + core + skill + cli + examples/integrations)
pnpm build
pnpm release:smoke
pnpm validate:public-repos
pnpm conductor:install-skills   # copy skills to ~/.cursor/skills
```

### Session lifecycle (CLIs)

```bash
pnpm conductor -- extract --project . --text "the ask"   # 1. draft (unfrozen)
pnpm conductor -- import-spec --project . --from auto     # optional spec import
pnpm conductor -- freeze  --project . --approved-by me    # 2. approve
pnpm conductor -- doctor  --project .                     # 3. diagnose setup
pnpm conductor -- check   --project . --staged            # 4. gate (exit 1 = blocked)
pnpm conductor -- report  --project . --staged            # PR/CI handoff
pnpm conductor -- rules   audit --project .               # project-rule hygiene
pnpm conductor -- pivot   --project . --change "..." --acknowledge
pnpm conductor -- correct --project . --wrong "..." --right "..." --rule "..." --acknowledge
pnpm conductor -- brief   --project .                     # clean re-injectable context
pnpm conductor -- resume  --project .                     # brief + recent history
```

[docs/release/beta-release-checklist.md](./docs/release/beta-release-checklist.md).
The gate
(`conductor check`, legacy `conductor-check`) is the one place Conductor
*enforces* rather than *suggests* —
wire it via [integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit.sample](./integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit.sample)
or [integrations/github-actions/conductor-drift-ci.yml.sample](./integrations/github-actions/conductor-drift-ci.yml.sample).
Use [pre-commit-with-vault-guard.sample](./integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit-with-vault-guard.sample)
or [conductor-vault-guard-ci.yml.sample](./integrations/github-actions/conductor-vault-guard-ci.yml.sample)
when you want a separate secret-scanning gate beside Conductor.

## Origin

Conductor grew out of repeated intent-drift failures in AI-assisted development workflows: vague prompts expanded scope, long sessions lost the original request, and reviews caught implementation quality more reliably than direction.
