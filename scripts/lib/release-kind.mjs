// Decides what kind of release a pushed tag is, and refuses the tag
// outright if it is neither kind.
//
// This repository ships two things from one tree: four npm packages
// (@vaultcompass/intent-guard-schema, @vaultcompass/intent-guard-core,
// @vaultcompass/intent-guard-skill and @vaultcompass/intent-guard,
// versioned in lockstep) and the composite GitHub Action at the repository
// root, whose `version` input defaults to the scanner version that action
// tag ships. Those two numbers are allowed to come apart, the same way
// dep-guard's did starting at its v0.6.1: action.yml, README, CHANGELOG and
// docs move, the packages stay where they are. Ported from dep-guard's
// scripts/lib/release-kind.mjs by way of vault-guard's generalised
// (name, version) array form -- see dep-guard's docs/INVARIANTS.md, "The
// action tag and the scanner version are two numbers", for the fuller
// history. This repository has no equivalent invariants doc to extend, so
// the reasoning below and in .github/workflows/release.yml's own comments
// is what stands in for one.
//
// A release whose kind was decided by a few lines of bash -- "the tag must
// read v plus the package version or the run fails" -- only knows that one
// shape, so an action-only tag would go red before install, build or
// publish and never get a Release page. The property that bought has to
// survive admitting the second shape: a mistyped or mis-pointed tag must
// never publish anything, and must never describe an unpublished version in
// a Release. An action-only tag is therefore not "any tag that is not an
// exact match" -- it is a tag that clears all of the conditions below, each
// of which closes off one way a typo could get through:
//
//   a. exact semver, no prerelease or build suffix, no leading zeros -- the
//      same shape action.yml validates its own version input against, so a
//      tag this repo blesses is a tag the action could be pinned to;
//   b. strictly greater than the package version by NUMERIC semver
//      ordering, so a tag onto an older line ("v1.5.0" while the packages
//      are at v1.10.0, which string comparison reads as a forward move) is
//      a mistake rather than a release;
//   c. every published package ALREADY on the registry at exactly the
//      package version, which is what makes "describes nothing unpublished"
//      true rather than merely likely;
//   d. action.yml's version default equal to the package version, because
//      an action-only tag ships the scanner that is already published -- if
//      the default moved, the scanner changed and this is a package release
//      whose packages were never bumped;
//   e. a CHANGELOG.md entry for the tag version, because every condition
//      above is also satisfied by a forgotten bump pushed as a new tag, and
//      what separates that from a release is that somebody wrote it down.
//
// The package path is not left unchecked either: it also requires
// action.yml's version default to equal the version being published, or the
// tag the release creates would install a different scanner than the
// release put on npm.
//
// The registry lookup is injected rather than imported so the tests can run
// offline; scripts/classify-release-tag.mjs supplies the real one.

// The shape a release tag (or a package version) must have to be treated as
// an exact release version: no prerelease, no build suffix, no leading
// zeros. Same pattern action.yml validates its `version` input against.

 *   * exactly one `default:` in the block, or it throws. Two would mean the
 *     file says two different things about what this action installs, and
 *     picking either one is a guess; YAML itself would resolve a duplicate
 *     key silently by taking the last, which is precisely the kind of quiet
 *     answer a release gate must not give.
 *
 * A real YAML parser would be better, but this file runs in the release job
 * BEFORE `pnpm install` (on purpose -- the whole point is to catch a
 * tag-time mistake before install, build and test even start), so it gets
 * node builtins and nothing else. Every failure here is fatal rather than a
